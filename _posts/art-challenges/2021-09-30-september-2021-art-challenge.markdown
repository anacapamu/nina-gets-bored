I tried to go with a central theme for this month's art challenge. Since it is September, I selected words that represent autumn.

I finished this art challenge super early because I made it a goal to try to draw everyday. I am definitely growing more confident by drawing more often. I don't think I have my own art style yet, but I am enjoying the process.
