A few Daiso stores in Southern California that I visited sold each Petit Block pack for $1.50 plus tax. The San Francisco and Dublin Daiso (as of February 9, 2020) do not sell these. If you do not have a Daiso around you or a Daiso that sells these, you can buy a pack for around $5 from third party merchants on Amazon or Ebay.

I received this pack for Christmas. It is the bulldog from the "Friends of Dogs & Cats" collection.

The base plate is around 1.65 in x 1.65 in. There are about 10 pieces remaining after completion.

**Overall impression:**Â I took 20 minutes nonstop to build this bulldog, which is much longer than I would like.I struggled because the instructions were confusing. The creator(s) wanted to condense multiple steps into one, so you really have to be good at mentally mapping 3D objects (which I am not) to complete a step correctly in one go.

The blocks are also not high quality, so they do not stay together well during construction. But for around $1.50, you can entertain yourself for 20 minutes and get a new cute little bulldog to decorate your shelf.
