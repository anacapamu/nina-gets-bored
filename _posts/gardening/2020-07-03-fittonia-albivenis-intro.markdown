![](https://i.imgur.com/hg2HnxQ.png) We have a few house plants in our office that no one was really taking care of. I was new to house plants when I joined the company, so I was eager to hone my gardening skills. I identified all the plants with the PictureThis app and learned more about them online. One of my coworkers told me that the nerve plant was a little drama queen because the leaves droops when it is thirsty. The leaves spring back up within a few hours if you water it right away. _Note: damage can be permanent if you don't water it soon, so avoid making the plant leaves droop._ I have included a photo of how the droopy leaves look like below. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ztnfe9P.jpg) Learning that this plant had a "personality," I needed it in my collection. I took two cuttings from the plant at the office and used [Raymond Lam's](https://raymondlamsk.blogspot.com/2017/03/how-to-propagate-fittonia-nerve-plant.html) method with Ziploc bags to propagate them. I did have to make some adjustments to his method and I did not take any photos the first time, so I will probably write my own blog post once I propagate the nerve plant again. I propagated these two cuttings back in September 2019 and I did not see progress for months. This is no longer a surprise after I learned that they tend to grow in late spring/early summer. I only have photos from April and June 2020 and you can clearly see how much they have grown in just two months. (I realized this might be confusing but I put both cuttings in the same pot after the April 2020 photo.) ![](https://i.imgur.com/rme0Grk.jpg)
