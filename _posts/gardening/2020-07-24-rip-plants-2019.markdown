I started gardening in 2019 when I finally had my own place with no roommates (other than my S.O., of course). Unfortunately and not surprisingly, some plants did not make it through the heat waves and my novice gardening skills. Let's take a moment to remember the fallen plants and the lessons I have learned from them.

Strawberry Plant 2
==================

*   Two moldy strawberries because they touched damp soil after a rainy day
*   Strawberries were relatively small

Cilantro
========

*   Cilantro bolted (you can see the formation of flowers on the top right of the photo) quickly because I placed it in direct sunlight during a heat wave
*   I was able to save the seeds to replant
