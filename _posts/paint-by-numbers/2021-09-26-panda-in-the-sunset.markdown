This paint by numbers took a total of 15.5 hours over the span of eight days to complete; which is the least time I spent among all four paint by numbers I have worked on. The colors of the sky could had been blended a bit better, but I really like how this one turned out.

I bought this kit a year ago for $6 from the same Amazon seller as the [Sunset by the Sea](https://ninagetsbored.wordpress.com/2021/09/19/paint-by-numbers-sunset-by-the-sea/) and [Whale and the Boat](https://ninagetsbored.wordpress.com/2020/11/18/paint-by-numbers-whale-and-the-boat/) kits. However, the manufacturer for this kit is either different from the other two or they changed how they make their products. Differences I noticed: 1) the sticker render doesn't have the difficulty rating, 2) the paper reference sheet does not have any Chinese instructions, and 3) the product number starts with an S instead of numbers and the Chinese title.

**Day 1 (.75 hour)** - I was so excited to start a new kit that I forgot to iron the back of the canvas to get rid of the creases.

**Day 2 (1.75 hours)** - I like to start with the larger areas first as it is easier for me to fill in the smaller details later. I like that this manufacturer label multiple areas of a large block with the same number so that you don't get lost and forget what number goes there. I hardly had to use the reference sheet for this kit due to the better numbering.

**Day 3 (1.5 hours)** - I have a bunch of cheap Aliexpress washi tapes that don't stick very well, so I decided to get rid of them by taping them around the border. This way, I don't have to be as careful when I paint the sides.

**Day 4 (2 hours)**

**Day 6 (2.25 hours)** - I was pleasantly surprised that the three different "blacks" are distinct enough from each other and that the difference isn't too stark to cause the grass or the panda to look weird.
