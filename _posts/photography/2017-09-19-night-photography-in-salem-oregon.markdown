I rarely use my DSLR because I think it is heavy to carry around everywhere and I do not think I can take good photos. I know, I know. If I do not practice, how will I ever get better?

Anyways, my boyfriend's brother is very into night photography; he especially likes to film the Milky Way. Since we were both in Oregon for the August 21st total solar eclipse, he showed me how to change the settings on my camera and how he shoots the Milky Way.

The following pictures are from my first attempt with night photography. There are a lot of noises in my pictures because of camera shake. I will definitely be getting a tripod so that I can avoid that in the future.

I did not edit the photos much since I know they are crappy anyways. I did change the exposure to brighten up the photos. Although they look nicer edited, I do not really like the pictures because they are not actual representation of the colors of the sky I saw that night.

I do not see stars often since I live in the city, but once I get my tripod, I will try to venture outside of the city and see what I can capture.
