I took an introduction to photography class two years ago. For one of our assignments, we had to use five images to compile a photo essay. I had fun shooting for this assignment because of the locations I visited and because I was able to alleviate some of the anger that I felt after something unfortunate happened. Someone (probably a drunk college student) smashed our car's front windshield when it was parked on the street overnight. I was able to lighten the annoyance of the situation by using the car as a prop for this photo essay. I definitely need to work on my lighting skills though. ![](https://i.imgur.com/TvBpQRj.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/q3SJBgo.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ngEsyTD.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/51KWrV8.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/trMC2EB.jpg)
