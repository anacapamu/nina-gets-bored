I took an introduction to photography class two years ago. For one of our assignments, we had to use five images to compile a photo essay.

I had fun shooting for this assignment because of the locations I visited and because I was able to alleviate some of the anger that I felt after something unfortunate happened. Someone (probably a drunk college student) smashed our car's front windshield when it was parked on the street overnight. I was able to lighten the annoyance of the situation by using the car as a prop for this photo essay.

I definitely need to work on my lighting skills though.
